# Scriptorium

Very early demo. README is Fedora 30-centric, and French-to-English centric (as that is my use case).

I target Python 3.7 to use mypy. 3.8 was a bit too new at the time I wrote this.

### Setup

[DAWG](https://github.com/pytries/DAWG) must be installed from source. Everything else is in the requirements.txt (and setup.py).

Discover the webcam you want to use as follows:

```
$ mpv av://v4l2:/dev/video4
```
